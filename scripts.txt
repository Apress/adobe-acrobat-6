// the object this.mailForm defines only the FDF content of the form, which is attached to the email.//

2.  alternate script for mailing form or form data:

var url = "mailto:name@address";
this.submitForm(url,false);

//The variable url is declared, and the mailto object and address are bound to it.  The form contents will be sent to the address in the variable.  

//In the second line, the variable is called (which will launch the email program and enter the address line).  The second argument, "false" will define the method used to send the information, and answers true or false to using the POST method.  
A value of "false" means the data will be sent in url-encoded fashion.  A value of "true" will send the data as FDF only.//
